# TED-Radio-Hour-Application
This mobile application in Android displays the episodes from the TED Radio Hour from NPR and user can listen to each of the episodes. We get the feeds from http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510298 . I have used RecyclerView, Action Bar and  Dynamic Layout Management.
